# SoundTrack
A group of Jupyter Notebooks that plays your music on a weekly schedule and shuffles song in between to fit the gaps. Written in Python3 and SQLite. It runs on Linux and plays to connected browser. Really cool Raspberry Pi (3 or higher) project.

Todo (20190806):
1. Upload database creation scripts.
2. Get working over a smart phone browser(IPython.display.Audio autoplay non-functioning).
3. Get working in a Tesla browser through group nightly prayer to Tesla's update team to allow HTML 5 sound of any kind.
