# SoundTrack
Your life's new soundtrack. A group of Jupyter Notebooks that plays your music on a weekly schedule and shuffles song in between to fit the gaps. Written in Python3 and SQLite. It runs on Linux and plays to connected browser. Really cool Raspberry Pi (3 or higher) project.

Todo (20190805):
1. Re-upload module and program files(cron script, pickle script, and main program).
2. Upload database creation scripts.
3. Upload seed mp3s(no license).
