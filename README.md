# SoundTrack
A group of Jupyter Notebooks that plays your music on a weekly schedule and shuffles song in between to fit the gaps. Written in Python3 and SQLite. It runs on Linux and plays to connected browser. Really cool Raspberry Pi (3 or higher) project.

Todo (20190805):
1. Re-upload module and program files(cron script, pickle script, and main program) using ssh.
  - watch youtube howto video github ssh, create ssh keys, committ or whatever it's called two remaining David Laganella          tunes(can convert to mp3 later using ffmpeg).
2. Upload database creation scripts.
3. Upload seed mp3s(no license).
4. Get working over a smart phone browser(IPython.display.Audio autoplay non-functioning).
5. Get working in a Tesla browser through group nightly prayer to Tesla's update team to allow HTML 5 sound of any kind.

Special thanks to:
