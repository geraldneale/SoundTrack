# SoundTrack
Summary:
A group of Jupyter Notebooks that plays your music on a weekly schedule and shuffles songs in between to fit the gaps. Written in Python3 and SQLite. It runs on Linux and plays to connected browser. Really cool Raspberry Pi (3 or higher) project.

Concept:

Soundtrack is an internet connected juke box with a calendar and alarm clock attached.

Created in early 2019 to make my routine life more cinematic through personal music collection curation. I open sourced it to put a line on my resume for programming Python3 and SQL. Now in the public domain do anything you want within the GPL3 constraints. The default settings let me curate your week using public domain music.
